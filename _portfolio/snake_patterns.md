* Project supervised by [Ousmane Kodio](https://me.ucsb.edu/people/ousmane-kodio)
* I used spectral methods to simulate the reaction-diffusion systems arising from modeling pattern formation on growing domanins. 
* Submitted for 18.354 Continuum systems
* Focused on analysing the pattern formation on growing domains problem by looking at snakes.
* Simulated the nonlinear PDE system with particular attention on the chemotaxis term.
* Project avilable [here](/files/18_354_Course_Project_javi_true_final.pdf)
