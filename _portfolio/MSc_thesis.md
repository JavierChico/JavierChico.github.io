In 2023 I completed my MSc thesis supervised by Demetrios Papageorgiou. I looked at ferrofluids falling under gravity, using asymptotic methods to reduced the magnetic Navier-Stokes equation to a single PDE for the moving interphase. This nonlinear PDE was solved numerically using the pseudospectral method.
