* Project supervised by Prof. Akylas
* Reviewd alternative models for epidemic spread, from simple SIR models to more complicated spatial models and network dynamics. 
* Submitted for 18.377 Nonlinear dynamics and waves.
* Used the method of multiple scales to approximate solutions to certain SI models with oscillations. 
* Used asymptotics to compute the epidemic front for simple models.
* Project avilable [here](/files/18_377_project_Javier.pdf)
