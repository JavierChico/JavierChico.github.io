* In 2023 I completed my MSc thesis supervised by Demetrios Papageorgiou.
* I looked at ferrofluids falling under gravity, using asymptotic methods to reduced the magnetic Navier-Stokes equation to a single PDE for the moving interphase.
* This nonlinear PDE was solved numerically using the pseudospectral method.
* My thesis is available [here](/files/M4R_report_Javi_final.pdf).
