Javier Chico Vazquez is a DPhil at the Mathematical Institute in Oxford, under the supervision of [Prof. Dominic Vella](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/vella/) and Prof. [Derek Moulton](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/moulton/). In my research I use techniques from Applied Mathematics to model phenomena in the natural sciences, the weirder the topic the more interesting. If you have a topic suggestion feel free to contact me!

I completed my BSc and MSc at Imperial College London, where I received the Governor's Prize in Mathematics, awarded to the best graduating student. My Master thesis research was on falling ferrofluids, under the supervision of Prof [D.T. Papageorgiou](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.papageorgiou).
