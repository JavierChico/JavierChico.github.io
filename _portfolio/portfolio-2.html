Project for 18.354 where I used spectral methods to simulate the reaction-diffusion systems arising from modeling pattern formation on growing domanins. 
<ul>
                  <li>Supervised by [Ousmane Kodio](https://me.ucsb.edu/people/ousmane-kodio) (MIT) for 18.354 Continuum systems</li>
                  <li>Focused on analysing the pattern formation on growing domains problem by looking at snakes. </li>
                  <li>Simulated the nonlinear PDE system with particular attention on the chemotaxis term. </li>
