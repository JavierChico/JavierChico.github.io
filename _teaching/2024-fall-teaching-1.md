I was a tutor for an MSc level course on [Perturbation Methods and asymptotic analysis](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/moulton/teaching.html), lectured by Prof. Ruth Baker. I was in charge of delivering problems classes for a group of students. Topics covered included: asymptotic approximation of integrals, matched asymptotic expansions (boundary layers), multiple scales and the WKB method.
